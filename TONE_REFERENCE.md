# Tone Reference — Fallen God

*A compiled inventory of all tone-relevant text in the game, for review and iteration.*

---

## The Voice

**Target register:** Serene confidence, total absence of self-awareness. The god never doubts, never explains, never apologizes. The player sees the chaos clearly. The god sees a job well done.

**The test sentence:** "Order restored. The tremors are unrelated."

**What it is NOT:**
- Not sarcastic (the god isn't winking at the player)
- Not tragic (he's not suffering)
- Not evil (he genuinely thinks he helped)
- Not a comedy game — the humor comes from the *gap*, not from jokes

**Closest reference:** Dionysus from Hades meets Catch-22. Grand. Confident. Oblivious.

## Menu & Navigation Strings

### Main Menu Tagline
> "You are a fallen god making obviously correct decisions that, for some reason, keep causing problems."

*Strong. Directly from the design doc. Keep.*

### Doctrine Selection Button
> "Begin Intervention"

*Good — in-voice. "Intervention" frames the run correctly.*

### Draft Phase Header
> "A Fragment of Power Resurfaces"

*Good — mythic register.*

### Draft Phase Subheader
> "One fragment must be reclaimed before the first crisis."

*Solid.*

### Boon Phase Header
> "Fragment Choice"

*Functional but flat. Could be: "A Fragment Surfaces" or "Reclaim a Fragment".*

### Boon Prompt (normal)
> "A forgotten fragment surfaces. Choose one power."

*Decent. Could lean more in-voice: "A fragment of your former power has surfaced. Claim it, or leave it."*

### Boon Prompt (threshold rupture)
> "Reality tears open. Claim one fragment before it seals."

*Strong. Keep.*

### Upgrade Phase Header
> "Intervention Complete"

*Good.*

### Skip Upgrade Button
> "Skip and Return to Void"

*Excellent. Keep exactly.*

### Withdraw Button
> "Withdraw"

*Clean and in-voice.*

### No Upgrades Available
> "No further refinements are available at this time."

*Good — formal and slightly absurd.*

## Doctrine Descriptions

### Doctrine of Dominion
- **Description:** "Order is restored by force applied with confidence."
- **Passive:** "Pressure abilities cost 1 less Strain."

*Both good. "Force applied with confidence" is perfectly in-voice.*

### Doctrine of Revelation
- **Description:** "Presence is power. Let them witness certainty."
- **Passive:** "Essence-focused abilities gain +1 Pressure and +1 Essence."

*"Let them witness certainty" is strong. Keep.*

## Ability Flavor Text

These are the short italic quotes shown on each ability card. They should read like things the god would say — or things said *about* the god's approach.

| Ability | Flavor Text | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Smite | "An elegant solution to a complex problem." | Excellent. Keep. |
| Manifest Presence | "They should know who is helping them." | Strong. Keep. |
| Twist Fate | "It was never meant to be this way. Let me fix it." | Good. Slightly more self-aware than ideal but works. |
| Condemn | "Subtlety was never your strong suit." | Good — gentle self-deprecation that the god doesn't recognize as such. |
| Witness | "You are merely an observer. For now." | Works. Slightly ominous — fine. |
| Absolve | "Mercy is a luxury you can afford." | Strong. Keep. |
| Stifle | "Hush now. The grownups are talking." | Excellent. The tone in one line. |
| Edict of Ash | "Policy written in lightning tends to be well respected." | Very good. Keep. |
| Supplication Chorus | "They kneel. You call this alignment." | Strong. Keep. |
| Open Rift | "Reality is mostly suggestions and signatures." | Excellent. Keep. |
| Ordain the Outcome | "This was always the plan. Write it down." | Strong. Keep. |
| Invoke the Faithful | "They are very motivated. This is their decision to manage." | Good — the god deflecting ownership. |
| Unravel the Record | "The records are unclear. They have always been unclear." | Excellent. Keep. |
| Divine Coercion | "Compliance was always going to be mandatory." | Strong. Keep. |

## Ability Descriptions (Synergy Text)

These appear on ability cards and in the draft screen. They need to explain the mechanic AND carry the voice.

| Ability | Description | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Smite | "Strike with divine force. If used after Manifest Presence, gain +1 Essence." | Clear and functional. |
| Manifest Presence | "Demand reverence. If used after Twist Fate, reduce current Strain by 2." | Good. |
| Twist Fate | "Alter the outcome. If used after Smite, the next ability costs 0 Strain." | Good. |
| Condemn | "Overwhelming judgment. Extreme pressure with dangerous consequences." | Fine. |
| Witness | "Observe the chaos. Essence without pressure, but instability spreads." | Good. "Observe the chaos" is nice. |
| Absolve | "Forgive their transgressions. Pure consequence reduction." | Good. |
| Stifle | "Silence the outcry. Balanced pressure with moderate relief." | Fine. |
| Edict of Ash | "Issue a binding decree. Strong pressure with essence and low consequences." | Fine. |
| Supplication Chorus | "Channel devotion into relief. Defensive essence generation." | Could have more voice: "Channel their devotion into something useful." |
| Open Rift | "Fracture reality itself. Extreme risk for extreme rewards." | Good. |
| Ordain the Outcome | "Declare the situation resolved by divine authority. If used after Manifest Presence, gain +2 Essence." | Clear. |
| Invoke the Faithful | "Direct mortal devotion as a force. If used after Witness, converts observation into +1 Pressure and reduces Consequence by 2." | Functional. |
| Unravel the Record | "Retroactively revise what happened. High pressure, unstable timeline. If used after Smite, reduce Consequence by 3." | Good. |
| Divine Coercion | "Apply direct divine authority. Significant pressure at moderate cost. If used after Ordain the Outcome, gain +3 Pressure." | Clear. |

## Encounter Titles and Descriptions

These frame the crisis the god is "solving." Should feel grand and slightly absurd.

| Encounter | Title | Description | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| storm | "Tempest Above the Harbor" | "Black water climbs the docks while your priests insist this is a blessing." | Excellent — "your priests insist this is a blessing" is perfect. |
| rebellion | "Heretical Uprising" | "A faction declares your silence proof of weakness. Admirable confidence." | Strong — "admirable confidence" from the god's perspective. |
| shrine | "Shrine Collapse" | "Your monument cracks open mid-ceremony. The crowd calls it symbolism." | Good. "The crowd calls it symbolism" is funny. |
| prayers | "Unanswered Prayers" | "Too many petitions, too little cosmos. Someone will call this neglect." | Good. "Too little cosmos" is a good line. |
| blight | "Harvest Blight" | "Fields blacken overnight. Mortals call it bad weather. You call it data." | Excellent. "You call it data" is the tone in four words. |
| drought | "The Sanctioned Drought" | "You redirected the river. The village will understand once the paperwork clears." | Strong. Keep. |
| miracles | "Surplus of Miracles" | "Your blessings were thorough. Too thorough. The harvest is extraordinary and nobody is coping well." | Good. "Nobody is coping well" from a god who is baffled by this. |
| heresy | "The Reasonable Philosopher" | "A mortal has posed several coherent questions about your recent decisions. This cannot go unanswered." | "Several coherent questions" is the right register. Could push further: "...about your recent decisions. He seems sincere. This is worse." |
| volcano | "Unsolicited Geological Opinion" | "The mountain has begun expressing views. You did not ask. You remain unimpressed." | "Unsolicited Geological Opinion" is a great title. Keep. |

## Encounter Context Text (pressureText, rewardText, consequenceText)

These small lines appear in the encounter card to explain what each meter represents. They should carry the god's framing.

| Encounter | pressureText | rewardText | consequenceText |
|---|---|---|---|
| storm | "Homes collapse under the surge." | "Recovered tribute from flooded vaults." | "Salt-soaked fear lingers in nearby provinces." |
| rebellion | "Influence fractures across the district." | "Seized offerings and public devotion." | "Rumors spread to the next settlement." |
| shrine | "Pilgrims abandon the holy route." | "Stone relics and pledged repairs." | "Unstable sanctuaries strain future interventions." |
| prayers | "Faith stagnates and requests become demands." | "Focused worship from those you answer." | "Ignored pleas harden into resentment." |
| blight | "Villages lose food and patience." | "Emergency rites yield concentrated Essence." | "Famine panic spills into neighboring lands." |
| drought | "Thirst sharpens the populace into something unpredictable." | "Concentrated devotion from those who blame the correct deity." | "Water rights disputes will outlast most current governments." |
| miracles | "Abundance becomes a crisis with sufficient volume." | "Tribute floods in, panicked but sincere." | "The over-blessed region will require correction in perpetuity." |
| heresy | "Logic spreads faster than most authorized doctrines." | "The faithful redouble their commitment to not asking." | "The questions remain. Merely unvoiced." |
| volcano | "Ash rains on temples that were recently re-dedicated." | "Emergency rites multiply under threat of imminent geology." | "The tectonic record is long and the mountain is patient." |

*Notes: Most of these are solid. "Blame the correct deity" (drought rewardText) is excellent. "Commitment to not asking" (heresy rewardText) is very good. "Tectonic record is long" (volcano) is strong.*

*Weakest: "Villages lose food and patience" (blight pressureText) and "Influence fractures across the district" (rebellion pressureText) are functional but could have more voice.*

## Encounter Modifier Descriptions

These describe the environmental condition modifying the encounter. Brief, punchy, in-voice.

| Modifier | Description | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Leyline Fracture | "The local leylines are split open. More power fits through than reality requested." | "Than reality requested" is excellent. |
| Sacred Site | "The shrine still remembers your old name. Reality is merely cooperative today." | Strong. Keep. |
| Fragile Reality | "This district is held together by prayer and wet timber. Your certainty may void both warranties." | "Void both warranties" — very good. |
| Devout Crowd | "They arrived pre-kneeling. Manifest commands carry twice the weight here." | "Arrived pre-kneeling" is perfect. |
| Stormsurge | "Wind and divinity argue over jurisdiction. Loudly." | Good. Clean. |
| Ritual Precision | "Every motion must be exact. Precision is expensive, but paperwork is cleaner." | "Paperwork is cleaner" is good. |
| Penitent Procession | "Forgiveness flows like water here. Absolve cleanses consequence completely." | Fine. A little mechanical — could add more voice. |
| Tribunal Square | "Judgment delivered here resonates across districts. Condemn becomes devastating." | Functional but dry. Could push: "Judgment delivered here carries weight. Possibly more than intended." |
| Hush of Ash | "The air is thick and quiet. Even rebellion whispers." | Strong. Keep. |
| Echoing Vault | "Decrees reverberate through stone and bureaucracy. Results multiply. So do side effects." | Excellent. |
| Iron Doubt | "Skepticism has been organized into a municipal policy." | Great line. Keep. |
| Cooperative Cosmos | "The stars filed your request in advance. You assume this is normal." | "You assume this is normal" — perfect tone. |
| Bureaucratic Ledger | "All miracles must be audited. Compliance is mandatory and strangely inspiring." | Good. |
| Midnight Vigil | "Observation becomes power itself. Witness generates essence; force becomes amplified." | A bit mechanical. Could be: "The watchers have gathered. They make everything more significant, including you." |
| Broken Idols | "Your statues are in pieces. The message is mixed, but volume remains high." | "Message is mixed, but volume remains high" — excellent. |
| Festival of Vows | "Everyone promised something dramatic today. You approve of this energy." | Perfect. Keep. |
| Ash-Choked Air | "The horizon is gray and irritable. Fate work is messy in this weather." | "Irritable" is a funny adjective for a horizon. Good. |

## Consequence Aftermath Strings

Shown after encounters where a specific ability category caused the most damage.

| Category | Text | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Smite | "Smite aftermath: the righteous fear you inspired has spread into neighboring districts. You consider this bonus coverage." | "Bonus coverage" is good — the god reframing spread as a feature. |
| Manifest | "Manifest aftermath: your followers have become emphatic. This is their decision to manage." | Good. The god declining ownership. |
| Twist | "Twist aftermath: reality has formed strong opinions about what you did. The details remain under review." | Strong. "Under review" is the right bureaucratic dodge. |

## Things Worth Reconsidering

These aren't broken, but could be sharper:

1. **"Heresy" encounter description** — could push harder on the god's specific bafflement at being questioned logically. The current version is good but there's room for one more twist.

2. **"Midnight Vigil" modifier** — the description drifts into mechanical explanation rather than voice. The other modifiers stay in register better.

3. **"Tribunal Square" modifier** — "Judgment delivered here resonates across districts. Condemn becomes devastating." reads like a tooltip. Compare to "Iron Doubt: Skepticism has been organized into a municipal policy." — the latter is much better. Tribunal could be: "The square was built for declarations. Condemn here is the declaration it was waiting for."

4. **Doctrine chosen lastResolution** — "[Doctrine] chosen. Select one fragment before the first intervention." is the first string the player sees and it's a bit flat. Consider: "[Doctrine] adopted. The realm awaits your expert attention." or "[Doctrine] chosen. A fragment resurfaces, as is tradition."

5. **Strain (Critical) note** — "The god is pushing too hard" breaks POV slightly (it's describing the god from outside). Better: "Overreach. Reality has begun pushing back."
